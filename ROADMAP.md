# Project Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines potential future improvements and refactoring tasks that could enhance the functionality, performance, and maintainability of the Accredify Verification API.

## 1. Refactoring

### 1.1 Improve Service Layer

- **Current State:** The service layer is functional but can be further modularized to improve scalability.
- **Future Improvement:** Introduce more granular services for each verification type (recipient, issuer, signature) to improve testability and separation of concerns.

### 1.2 Validation Enhancement

- **Current State:** Validation is handled within services, but complex validation could be extracted into form request classes.
- **Future Improvement:** Utilize Laravel’s Form Request validation to handle complex validation scenarios more effectively.

## 2. New Features

### 2.1 Caching Mechanism

- **Goal:** Implement a caching layer to store DNS responses, reducing the number of external API calls and improving response times.
- **Details:** Use Laravel’s cache system to store DNS TXT record lookups for a configurable amount of time.

### 2.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Goal:** Add RBAC to control access to different parts of the API based on user roles.
- **Details:** Implement a roles and permissions system using Laravel’s built-in authentication and authorization features.

## 3. Performance Optimization

### 3.1 Query Optimization

- **Current State:** The current implementation is straightforward but may benefit from query optimization.
- **Future Improvement:** Analyze and optimize database queries to reduce load times and improve scalability.

## 4. Documentation Improvements

### 4.1 Detailed API Documentation

- **Goal:** Expand the API documentation to include more detailed descriptions and examples for each endpoint.
- **Details:** Use Swagger’s advanced features to provide in-depth documentation, including example requests and responses.
